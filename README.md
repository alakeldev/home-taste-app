Our mission is to empower home cooks by providing them with a dedicated space to showcase their culinary talents.

## Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. It allows teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver valuable features incrementally. In this project, we follow Agile principles to enhance productivity and ensure successful project delivery.

- User Stories and Github Issues: I utilized Github issues to create detailed user stories for my project. Each user story included essential components such as story points, acceptance criteria, and associated tasks.These user stories were tracked either on the Kanban board or within the issues themselves.
- Kanban Board for Prioritization: The Github Kanban board played a crucial role in managing my project. User stories were assigned to specific issues, allowing me to define clear goals and priorities. Labels were used to further categorize and prioritize user stories within the Kanban board.

Project Sections: my project was organized into the following sections:

- To-do: User stories awaiting implementation.
- In-progress: Ongoing work.
- Done: Completed tasks.
- Won‚Äôt-do: Items were defined as future features.

Sprint Planning with totla (5) Milestones:

- I structured the work into sprints using milestones.
- Each sprint had well-defined objectives.

### Hidden Features

- Passwords Manager App Start:<br>
When the user answer ‚Äòyes‚Äô to the question: ‚ÄòDo you want to start the Passwords Manager Application for the first time?‚Äô, a new file named ‚Äòthe-security-key.key‚Äô will be created, and a symmetric key will be generated and stored inside that file.

- Passwords Manager App - "Save" Path:<br>
When the user chooses the 'save' path and enters a username and password fields (without leaving any fields empty or with only one character), these entries will be saved inside ‚Äòmy-passwords.txt‚Äô. Then, a function will run to retrieve the data from ‚Äòmy-passwords.txt‚Äô and will encrypt the retrieved data with the symmetric key that was stored inside ‚Äòthe-security-key.key‚Äô. The encrypted data will then be stored inside a new file named ‚Äòmy-encrypted-data.txt‚Äô.

- Passwords Manager App - "View" Path:<br>
When the user chooses the 'view' path and there are previously saved passwords inside ‚Äòmy-passwords.txt‚Äô, a function will run to retrieve the data from this file and will encrypt the retrieved data with the symmetric key that is stored inside ‚Äòthe-security-key.key‚Äô. The encrypted data will then be stored inside a new file named ‚Äòmy-encrypted-data.txt‚Äô. Then, another function will run to decrypt the data from ‚Äòmy-encrypted-data.txt‚Äô file with the same key and print it out on the terminal.

- Passwords Manager App - "Exit" Path:<br>
When the user chooses to exit the Passwords Manager Application and there is previously saved data, a function will run and ask if they want to remove the previously saved data. If the user enters ‚Äòyes‚Äô, a new function will run that will delete all of the data inside the files ‚Äòmy-passwords.txt‚Äô and ‚Äòmy-encrypted-data.txt‚Äô.

### Future Features

- Create an account for each user that shows only their passwords and requires a master password and username to access.
- Remove and edit a specific saved username or password inside the file without affecting any other saved data.
- Password expiration reminders, two-factor authentication.
- Create a simple and beautiful GUI for the application.

## Testing

- Extensive testing was completed to review each possible path/scenario a user might take. This was to ensure looping back to the specific and related point, error messages that can be understood by the user were shown to them and finally no dead ends were encountered.
- Check the project flowchart to get each path detail by clicking [HERE](https://alakeldev.github.io/pp3-diagram/).

### Validator Testing

- The code has been tested by using [PEP8-CI Heroku-App](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/):<br>
As shown in the photo below, there is an error on line 127 that says ‚Äúinvalid escape sequence ‚Äò\d‚Äô‚Äù. After conducting extensive searches and consulting with CI tutor support, I was unable to avoid this error as it is related to a ‚ÄúRegular Expression‚Äù.
