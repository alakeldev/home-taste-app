## UX

### Site Purpose

It is website that bridges the gap between passionate home chefs and food enthusiasts. Our mission is to empower home cooks by providing them with a dedicated space to showcase their culinary talents. Chefs can register, create personalized profiles, and share essential information such as contact details, cooking schedules, and captivating images of their signature dishes. Visitors, in turn, have the privilege of exploring comprehensive chef profiles, accessing public information, and leaving valuable feedback through comments.

### Site Goals

- Empowerment: to empower home cooks by providing them with a website to express their creativity, share their love for cooking, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals.
- Visibility: to increase the visibility of home chefs and their unique offerings, allowing them to reach a broader audience.
- Interaction: to foster connection between chefs and visitors, encouraging feedback, culinary discussions, and appreciation.

### Audience

Home Taste caters to two main audiences:

- Home Chefs: Passionate home cooks who want to showcase their skills, build a personal chef profile, and connect with fellow food enthusiasts.

## Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. It allows teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver valuable features incrementally. In this project, we follow Agile principles to enhance productivity and ensure successful project delivery.

- User Stories and Github Issues: I utilized Github issues to create detailed user stories for my project. Each user story included essential components such as story points, acceptance criteria, and associated tasks.These user stories were tracked either on the Kanban board or within the issues themselves.
- Kanban Board for Prioritization: The Github Kanban board played a crucial role in managing my project. User stories were assigned to specific issues, allowing me to define clear goals and priorities. Labels were used to further categorize and prioritize user stories within the Kanban board.

Project Sections: my project was organized into the following sections:

- To-do: User stories awaiting implementation.
- In-progress: Ongoing work.
- Done: Completed tasks.
- Won‚Äôt-do: Items were defined as future features.

Sprint Planning with totla (5) Milestones:

- I structured the work into sprints using milestones.
- Each sprint had well-defined objectives.

3. inside the created repo select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right hand side.
4. Ensure HTTPS is selected and click the clipboard on the right of the URL to copy it.
5. Open VS-code, creat new project folder, open the terminal, On the terminal type "git clone", then paste the copied url and press 'Enter'.
6. Version control was used throughout the project using the following commands in the terminal:
    - git add . <strong>OR</strong> git add "file name" - to stage the changes and get them ready for being committed to the local repo.
    - git commit -m "Description of the update" - to save the change and commit the change to the local repo
    - git push origin main - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repo.

### Forking

1. Go to [the project repository](https://github.com/alakeldev/home-taste-pp4).
2. In the right most top menu, click the "Fork" button.
3. There will now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

### Cloning the repo & Running the project locally

1. Go to the following repository on GitHub: <https://github.com/alakeldev/home-taste-pp4>.
2. At the top right of the screen, click the 'Code' button, and then click 'HTTPs'.
3. Copy the link in this field.
4. Open VS-code, creat new project folder, open the terminal.
5. On the terminal type "git clone", then paste the copied url and press 'Enter'.
6. The clone process should now begin.

### Deploying with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the [Code Institute tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CncA1F2JClME2S_K0w4XoV3edMjOl_HrOQoEs3h9LOo/edit#heading=h.hvy9tw74f1o0):

The following command in the IDE will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.

1. Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and login, if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
2. Click the `New` dropdown and select `Create New App`.
3. Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
4. Select the region you are working in.

#### Heroku Settings  

You will need to set your Environment Variables - this is a key step to ensuring your application is deployed properly.

1. In the Settings tab, click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables:
    - Add key: `PORT` & value `8000`. This can be delete for final deployment.
    - Add key: DATABASE_URL and the value as your ElephantSQL database URL e.g.
    - Add key: CLOUDINARY_URL and the value as your cloudinary API Environment variable e.g.
    - Add key: SECRET_KEY and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing.
    - Add `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` if you are still working on the project. This can be delete for final deployment.

2. In your project:
    - Create a file `env.py` and put it into `.gitignore`.
    - Add your settings, like DATABASE_URL, CLOUDINARY_URL and SECRET_KEY to `env.py`.
    - Comment out the original DATABASE settings from `settings.py` and add default Database code.
    - Run your migrations.

#### Heroku Deployment

In the Deploy tab:

1. Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
    - Click on the `Deploy` tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.
    - Enter the GitHub repository name and click on `Search`.
    - Choose the correct repository for your application and click on `Connect`.
2. You can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github, whereas manual deployment requires you to push the `Deploy Branch` button whenever you want a change made.
3. Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked `Deploy Branch` your application will be built and you should now see the `View` button, click this to open your application.
4. Be sure to delete settings in Heroku like `PORT` and `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`, set `DEBUG` to `False` in your `settings.py` and add `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` there.
